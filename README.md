# Why ?

The main reason for this project is to learn more about full stack web development. As a side effect, it may also be used as a minimal version of roll20. I like roll20 but sometimes it feels way too heavy for a quick rpg game with friends, so I thought the world needed a more lightweight version of it.

# What ?

This is a web application allowing multiple users to join in a private virtual room, roll some dices, draw ugly battlemaps and move tokens on it so that they can enjoy a roleplaying game online.

# Technical stack :

- **MongoDB** for the database
- **Express** for the API
- **Nodejs** for the back end
- **React** for the front end
- **Redux** for the front end state management
- **Socket.io** to manage real-time events
- **Cypress** for the end to end tests
- **Github** Actions to run continuous integration
- **Heroku** for the deployments and hosting

Also tried Golang for the backend but I finally decided to focus on javascript for this project.
